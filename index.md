- Introductory presentation: 50 min
- Hands-on activities: 20-50 min

## Why Power BI? 

[Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/){:target="_blank"} is a Microsoft solution for data visualizations and dashboards. BI stands for "Business Intelligence", as you can use it to make meaningful data-driven decisions.

This workshop uses Power [BI desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-what-is-desktop){:target="_blank"}, a local version of Power BI, because it is free to download and use. 

This workshop is not an endorsement of Power BI; there are many options for data visualizations and dashboards software may be better in other contexts. While an excellent tool, Power BI imposes some limitations that users should be aware of:

- Limited user input, apart from filtering
- Limitations on visualization creativity
- Requires some use of coding with DAX and M code
- Large data models make the report slow
- Poorly made data models could make the report inaccurate

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Load a CSV spreadsheet into power BI
2. Make simple data transformations with Power Query
