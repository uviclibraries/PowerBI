# Part 3 Visualizations

In this visualization stage, you have more freedom to play around, as you have now formatted your data to work well within the visualizations.

The visualization pane shows icons representing the different visualizations. If you hover over an icon, the name of the visualization shows in the tooltip.

Step 1: add the data to a visualization
1. click on an icon from the visualizations pane. 
        
    NOTE: I would suggest one of the first 4 bar charts, the line chart or one of the pie charts to start, as they are the easiest to work with. In the example below, I use the clustered column chart.
2. take a look at the field boxes that appear in the visualization pane when you create a visualization. Each of these boxes either expects a measure (ie Global Sales), or a field value (ie Genre).

    NOTE: if a measure is expected, but you drag a field in, it might automatically convert the field to a measure (ie Count of Genre). Watch out for that as you are playing around.

3. drag measures and fields from the data pane into the data field boxes in the visualizations pane. play with moving the data around and adding different data to see what happens.

    NOTE: your visualization should have at least one measure from your KeyMeasures table, or the fields wont properly connect with each other. This is because of the way we build our model (and the directions of the relationships)
